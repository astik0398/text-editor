# Simple Text Editor with Font Customization and Auto Save

This project implements a simple yet powerful text editor with customizable font options and auto save functionality. It allows users to select from a wide range of Google Fonts to style their text, with the ability to adjust font weights according to their chosen font family. The italic toggle is intelligently activated based on whether the selected font family and weight combination supports italics.

## Features

- **Font Selection**: Choose from a comprehensive list of Google Fonts to apply to your text.
- **Font Weight Customization**: Adjust the font weight to emphasize or refine your text's appearance.
- **Dynamic Italic Toggle**: Toggle italic styling, available only if the selected font family and weight support it.
- **Auto Save**: Save your text and font preferences locally within the browser.
- **Persistent Storage**: Upon reloading the page, your previous content and font selections are restored automatically for a seamless editing experience.
